# Proposal: Predicting Burned Calories on Workout

## Data Overview:


## Source:
from Kaggle website: 

## Size of Data:
- Number of rows: 15,000
- Number of columns: 9

## Columns description:
Below is a description of the columns: 
- User_ID: unique number
- Gender: male or female
- Age: person age
- Height: person height
- Weight: person weight
- Duration: exercise duration
- Heart_Rate: Heart rate during exercise
- Body_Temp: Body temperature during exercise
- Calories: The number of calories burned

## Question:
1. How can age affect performance time during a workout?

2. What are the factors that affect how high or low heart rate during a workout?

3. What is the rate of burning calories compared to the time of workout?

4. What is the difference between male and female in the duration of workout and burned calories?

5. Is there a relationship between weight and burned calories?

6. What are the oldest ages that achieve high calorie burn?

7. Is there a difference between male and female in height and weight?
## Tools:
- Libraries: 
pandas, 
numpy, 
matplotlib, 
seaborn, 
plotly, 
sklearn

- Softwares: 
Trello, 
GitHub, 
Jupyter, 
VSCode, 
PowerPoint, 
Word

## MVP goals:
1. Find out what factors affect how high and low the heart is during exercise.

2. We want to get the difference between males and females in the duration of exercise and calories burned.

3. We get the calorie burn rate compared to your workout time.

4. We conclude the oldest ages that achieve high calorie burning.
